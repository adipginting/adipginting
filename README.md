- 👋 Hi, I’m @adipginting
- 👀 I’m interested in the world wide web, computational physics, and artificial intelligence.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript (node, react, mongo), c++, php (laravel), c# (dotnet core), golang, redis, and SQL (postgreSQL, mySQL, sqlite, sequelize).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really.
- 📫 You can reach me here or if you want on Twitter @adipginting.
