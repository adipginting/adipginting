- 👋 Hi, I’m @adipginting
- 👀 I’m interested in the world wide web, computational physics, statistical physics, cryptography, and artificial intelligence.
- 🌱 I’m currently focusing the javascript ecosystem (TypeScript, Node.js, React.js, Express.js, and soon Nest.js) and learning OpenAPI, Docker, and Database (PostgreSQL) on the side.
- 🚀 I'm interested to learn Golang and Rust this year when I have time, but not for the time being.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building website and cloud technology.
- 📫 You can reach me here or if you want on Twitter @adipginting.
